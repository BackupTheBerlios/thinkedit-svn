Those files are not unit test, altough I'd like them to become real tests some day.

They are meant to describe a use case for each Thinkedit class.

Some of them are failled attempts, other are usefull documentations

In all cases, DO NOT LEAVE THIS FOLDER ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE, 
the files here do no security check most of the time, 
and some perform destructive operations on the DB (most of the time they don't)
