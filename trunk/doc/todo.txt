TODO :
- filesystem function to generate 'safe filenames' (url friendly) (remove accents, space, etc...)
- node order fix bugs
- friendly urls (in node class) / node->loadByUrl() and node->loadByPath($path)
- allow config folder outside doc root (madatory, xml config files are world readable!), with recursive search. Todo security
- locale support
- translate() for interface and public website
- version support
- mysql backticks
- tags to use in templates and content
- password reminder (or disable feature in admin until there)
- custom error handlers with pretty display
- production / development mode (only show error details if in dev mode) AND only allow debug in dev mode as well todo : security


Almost there :
- db sync tool (sync DB to xml (and vice-versa?))
- templates for public site (header / footer / template for each content type)

DONE :
- tree (nodes)
- config folder instead of single file (recursive search)
- security
-- inside classes (like record)
-- inside the interface with redirect to login form
-- user permision : $user::hasPermission($permission, $object)
- login form
- file management
- relations

Discarded :
- datagrid global actions
