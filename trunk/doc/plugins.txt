Thinkedit plugin system
(work in progress)


I'd like to use the same "hooks" system as wordpress which seems very sucessfull.
Hooks look like observer pattern

some ideas : 

- be able to autogenerate the list of availables hooks (they should not be hidden in code)
- have the authors of plugins write a php class (and not a simple function)
- provide an api to register a plugin, either for an action or for a filter. Without distinction


$pluginmanager->register('') ?

Use case : write a plugin to put all titles fields uppsercase (but not save them in the db)

hook name is : 'record_get'

class myplugin
{
	function register()
	{
		global $thinkedit,
		$thinkedit->register($this, 'make_uppercase', 'record_get'); 
	}
	
	function make_uppercase($field)
	{
	  return uppercase($field);
	}
}
