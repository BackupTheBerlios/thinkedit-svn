Here are the things I keep in my head when developping Thinkedit. Those are more personnal notes, but waybe those are usefull to someone else or a newcomer to the project.

- All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky. (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html)

- Less is often more, but not always (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/09.html and a lot of others)

- OO Getters and setters are not evil, they allow validation of programmer suplied data in the context of a dynamic langage without strong typing such as php.

- Writing uses cases is fun and very usefull
