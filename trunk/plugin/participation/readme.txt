Participation plugin for thinkedit.


Use case :

Someone wants to add forum feature to a site. A forum is a container, it can contain discussions. Discussions can contain question and answers, those are also discussion. This way we have a threaded forum.

Anywhere in your site, you can add a participation object


Installation :
Unpack the forum folder inside your plugin directory. Run the thinkedit installer to update your database.

Use :
- Anywhere in your site tree, you can now add a participation
- By modifying the participation item you just created, you can define :

   - the title 
	 - what will be added by users (content type, by default it will be a discussion
	 - if the participation is threaded (means that a user can add a discussion within another discussion) = threaded forum
	 - if you want to moderate participations
	 - if you want to receive an email each time the forum receives participation
