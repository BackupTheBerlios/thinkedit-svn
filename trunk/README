Thinkedit, probably the best thing since sliced bread

An open source CMS, see licence.txt (it's GPL)

Welcome to ThinkEdit, a simple, web based, content and data management system. In short, Thinkedit is an open source (free) content management system, written in php.

With thinkedit, you can quickly :

    * create content types (you define the differents fields of your content)
    * structure your content (in a tree)
    * make relations between your content items

This is all about separating content and presentation, and giving a powerfull tool that is an exact representation of your problem : managing content.
