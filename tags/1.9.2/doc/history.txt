For a complete history, look at the svn comit logs

31/05/2006 : Approaching a 2.0 public release ! 

10/02/2005 : session::persist() and api.txt
More focus on simple datagrid like data management, then will focus on tree like content management

4/12/2004 : node and module content separated. css added. page class resurected form oldies
Implemented path management on the include side of things. Need to fix also paths management on the user (browser/http side)

7/7/2004 : reimplemented without pear db class. No dependency and simplier db accesses.
db.class.php is the reference implementation. I won't do compromises on refactoring. If all must be rewritten, then let it be rewritten.


1/1/2004 : start of the project, this is the third attempt at doing a data / content management system with universal features
