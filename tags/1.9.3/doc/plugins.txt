Thinkedit plugin system
(work in progress)


I'd like to use the same "hooks" system as wordpress which seems very sucessfull.
Hooks look like observer pattern

some ideas : 

- be able to autogenerate the list of availables hooks (they should not be hidden in code)
- have the authors of plugins write a php class (and not a simple function)
- provide an api to register a plugin, either for an action or for a filter. Without distinction


$pluginmanager->register('') ?

Use case : write a plugin to put all titles fields uppsercase (but not save them in the db)

hook name is : 'record_get'

class myplugin
{
	function register()
	{
		global $thinkedit,
		$thinkedit->register($this, 'make_uppercase', 'record_get'); 
	}
	
	function make_uppercase($field)
	{
	  return uppercase($field);
	}
}

First IDEA :
------------

<?php

/*
Thinkedit plugin example

Idea 1 : wordpress style plugin system :

*/



function mail_me_on_article_add($record)
{
		// code that sends an email
}


// plugin->on($action, $callback)
$thinkedit->plugin->on('create_record',  'mailMeOnArticleAdd');

?>



Second idea : 
-------------
<?php
/*
Thinkedit plugin example

Scenario
Thinkedit plugin manager would scan the /plugin folder, and include and instantiante all classes found

Then it would create an array of all the methods found in those classes


*/


class test
{
		// maybe even not needed :
		function init()
		{
				global $thinkedit;
				$thinkedit->plugin->register($this);
		}
		
		
		// how to define an api for this ?
		function onAddRecord($record)
		{
				// code that sends an email when a record is added
		}
		
		
}
?>
