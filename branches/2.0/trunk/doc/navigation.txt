How navigation in templates works


There are different classes for navigation. They are all of this pattern :

menu.xxx.class.php where xxx is the menu type

for example main menu (top level) is menu.main.class.php


Each menu class has at least those methods : 

- render() -> renders the menu as html, for simple use cases

- getArray()->gives an array of menu items :
  A menu item has those methods :
	
	- getTitle()
	- getUrl()
	- getLevel()
	- isCurrent();
	
	etc...

	
You can use either render() to render the menu for you or getArray() to generate the html yourself
